# Artificien: Jupyter

This repository contains code relating to deploying a multi-user juypter notebook service that integrates with the Artificien platform. This serves to spawn single-user jupyter servers to allow clients to work with sample data and build their models on the Artificien Marketplace web application.

Core Needs
- More than one user has to be able to use
- Different users must have different file spaces
- Different users must have different accounts
- Users must me able to save files
- Users must be able to send completed Pysyft models to Pygrid engine for deployment
- Integration with Artificien website on the frontend

Stretch
- Scalable/inexpensive infrastructure to accomodate many users at one
